# Recruitment-Automation-System-
This is a project to automate the recruitment process within an organization. This system is planned to include facilities for publishing job vacancies, accepting online applications, processing applications sent as a hard copy, handling the scheduling of exams and interviews, keeping track of the recruitment records etc.

Recruitment is a large and a time consuming process in most of the organization, where they receive quite lot of job application for vacancies being called. It would take a much effort, time and cost to handle those job applications manually. Also the HR staff has to manually shortlist the received applications and schedule exams and interviews for them. This long process make the this business function inefficient.
